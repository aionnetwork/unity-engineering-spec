# Aion-Unity Engineering Specification 

This is a complete specification for the Aion-Unity upgrade, documenting the design of the staking, delegation and incentive schemes introduced in the release.

**Note that this is a preliminary draft, and specification details are subject to change prior to mainnet release.**

This draft mostly focuses on the staking and stake delegation mechanisms; addendums specifying other sub-systems and schemes to follow.
