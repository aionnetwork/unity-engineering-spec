\section{System Smart Contracts}
\label{appendix:contract}

Following are the AVM smart contracts (extracted as Java interfaces) for the staking and delegation contracts. Only the functions utilized in the major control flows (as described in appendix \ref{appendix:sequence_diagrams}) are provided. Also note that access modifiers (e.g. public, private, etc.) at the class and method level have also been stripped for brevity.

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Java , escapeinside={(*@}{@*)}]
interface StakerRegistry {
    void registerStaker(Address identityAddress, Address managementAddress,
                        Address signingAddress, Address coinbaseAddress, 
                        Address selfBondAddress);
    void vote(Address staker);
    void unvote(Address staker, long amount);
    void unvoteTo(Address staker, long amount, Address receiver);
    int finalizeUnvote(Address owner, int limit);
    void transferStake(Address fromStaker, Address toStaker, long amount);
    int finalizeTransfer(Address staker, int limit);
    void setSigningAddress(Address newSigningAddress);
    void setCoinbaseAddress(Address newCoinbaseAddress);
}

interface PoolRegistry {
    Address registerPool(Address signingAddress, int commissionRate, 
                         byte[] metaDataUrl, byte[] metaDataContentHash);
