\section{System Smart Contracts}
\label{appendix:contract}

Following are the AVM smart contracts (extracted as Java interfaces) for the staking and delegation contracts. Only the functions utilized in the major control flows (as described in appendix \ref{appendix:sequence_diagrams}) are provided. Also note that access modifiers (e.g. public, private, etc.) at the class and method level have also been stripped for brevity.
